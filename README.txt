The project is to simulate a UR5 robot only under the influence of gravity.
The joint angles for simulation are generate using MATLAB code as givin in "Code".
The output of the Code is a .csv file containing the joint angles for the UR5 robot wrt time.
This file is given as input the the CopellaiSim model of UR5 robot and the video files were created.
The method and Code library are used from Modern Robotics book.
